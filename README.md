# Robot Wars

A simple console application for a game of Robot Wars!

## Getting Started

* Run with Ctrl - F5. Follow Console instructions! 
* Uses simple IoC container to dependancy inject services.
* Solutions split up into RW.Core for Core/Shared Classes, RW.Services for services classes, RW.Tests for tests, RobotWars for Entry.

## Running the tests

Tests written with MSTest. Use VS Test Runner to run these.

In a real world application I would have x2/x3 the amount of test cases here. But here is a start to how my test architecture would look like.

## Built With

.NET Core Console Application
